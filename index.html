I would do research for hours to come up with a number, but never felt confident in the answer that I would settle on.Now, I don't have to go through this hassle and can focus on being a great host to my visitors!"</p>

                    <p>"I've worked with OptimalBNB for a little over a year now and am thrilled with them. I have a full time job, and never thought that I could manage the time commitment necessary make extra money as an Airbnb host. However, Optimalbnb made the pricing side easy, so all I had to do was keep my place clean and be friendly to the visitors. This is a very convenient and straightforward tool for part-time hosts like me."</p>
